We are thrilled to announce the 2021 edition of our annual CTF, which will begin next week on **November 30 10:00 CEST**! We encourage participants to register and find about the details on the dedicated website: **[https://donjon-ctf.io](https://donjon-ctf.io)**. The competition will run for 3 weeks and end on December 21, 18:00 CEST.

The competition will be a jeopardy CTF open to anyone, with more than 20 challenges close to problems encountered in real life. Most of them will be independent from each other and standard categories such as cryptography, exploitation, reverse engineering or side channel attacks will be covered. Be also prepared to solve challenges usually missing in online CTFs! Ranging from hardware security to blockchain vulnerabilities, these challenges should give participants a glimpse into the security research conducted by the Donjon on a daily basis.

We increased rewards, compared to last year's edition. The ten best participants will win the following prizes:

- 1st prize: 500$ in cryptocurrencies + 1 limited edition Ledger Backup Pack
- 2nd prize: 300$ in cryptocurrencies + 1 limited edition Ledger Backup Pack
- 3rd prize: 100$ in cryptocurrencies + 1 limited edition Ledger Backup Pack
- 4th - 10th prizes: 1 limited edition Ledger Nano X
