# CTF 2020: Capture the Fortress

We are thrilled to officially announce the Ledger Donjon CTF, which will begin next week on **October 28 10:00 CEST**! We encourage participants to register and find about the details on the dedicated website: **[https://donjon-ctf.io](https://donjon-ctf.io)**. The competition will run for 3 weeks and end on November 18, 2020 18:00 CEST.

The competition will be a jeopardy CTF open to anyone, with more than 15 challenges close to problems encountered in real life. Most of them will be independant from each other and standard categories such as cryptography, exploitation, reverse engineering or side channel attacks will be covered. Be also prepared to solve challenges usually missing in online CTFs! Ranging from hardware security to blockchain vulnerabilities, these challenges should give participants a glimpse into the security research conducted by the Donjon on a daily basis.

Last but not least, the ten best participants will win the following prizes:

- 1st prize: 400$ + 1 limited edition Ledger Backup Pack
- 2nd prize: 100$ + 1 limited edition Ledger Backup Pack
- 3rd prize: 1 limited edition Ledger Backup Pack
- 4th - 10th prizes: 1 limited edition Ledger Nano X
